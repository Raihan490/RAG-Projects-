1.🧑‍💼🤖 AI Career Conversations (RAG Chatbot)

This project is an interactive AI career-guidance chatbot built using a free OpenRouter API key and deployed on HuggingFace Spaces. It allows users to chat with an AI version of my professional side, powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

In this project, you’ll find:

📚 A RAG pipeline that retrieves your professional background data

🤖 A chat interface that answers career-related questions using accurate context

🔌 Integration with OpenRouter’s free API for model access

🌐 A fully deployed HuggingFace Space for easy public use

💬 A clean UI where users can ask for guidance, insights, or advice
